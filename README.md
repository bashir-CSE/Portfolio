## üöÄ How to Run Locally

To set up and run this project on your local machine, you will need a live server environment and an SCSS compiler.

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/bashir-CSE/Portfolio.git
    ```
2.  **Navigate to the project directory:**
    ```sh
    cd Portfolio
    ```
3.  **Compile SCSS:**
    -   For VS Code users, the **Live Sass Compiler** extension is recommended (configured in `.vscode/settings.json`).
    -   Click "Watch Sass" in the VS Code status bar to automatically compile `scss/styles.scss` to `css/styles.min.css`.
4.  **Run with a Live Server:**
    -   Use a VS Code extension like **Live Server**.
    -   Right-click `index.html` and select "Open with Live Server". This is crucial for `particles.js` to correctly load its `particles.json` configuration file.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

The contact form functionality relies on EmailJS for sending messages.

1.  Create a `.env` file in the root directory of the project (this file is ignored by Git for security).
2.  Copy the contents from `.env.example` into your newly created `.env` file.
3.  Replace the placeholder values with your actual EmailJS `Public Key`, `Service ID`, and `Template ID`.
4.  **Important Security Note:** Configure the allowed domains in your EmailJS dashboard to only accept requests from your live website URL to prevent unauthorized usage.
